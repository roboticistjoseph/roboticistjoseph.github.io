## Agenda

This project focuses on developing a system for human detection and tracking with PID control in soft robotics applications. The goal is to create a responsive and adaptive control system that can safely interact with humans while maintaining precise control.

Key objectives include:
- Implementing robust human detection and tracking algorithms
- Developing PID control systems for soft robotic actuators
- Creating safety mechanisms for human-robot interaction
- Testing the system in various environmental conditions
- Evaluating performance metrics for detection accuracy and control precision

## Technical Discussion

The system consists of several integrated components:

- **Perception System**: Computer vision algorithms for human detection and tracking
- **Control System**: PID controllers for soft actuators with adaptive parameters
- **Safety Monitoring**: Real-time assessment of interaction safety
- **User Interface**: Visualization and configuration tools
- **Data Logging**: Recording and analysis of system performance

### Key Technologies

The project leverages several advanced technologies:

- **Deep Learning**: Convolutional neural networks for human detection and pose estimation
- **PID Control**: Proportional-Integral-Derivative control with gain scheduling
- **Soft Robotics**: Pneumatic or hydraulic soft actuators with compliant behavior
