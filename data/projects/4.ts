# Project Insights

## Agenda

This project focuses on developing state space estimation techniques for an inverted pendulum system. The goal is to accurately estimate the full state of the system in real-time to enable robust control.

Key objectives include:
- Implementing various state estimation algorithms (Kalman Filter, Extended Kalman Filter, Particle Filter)
- Comparing performance across different estimation techniques
- Developing a robust sensor fusion approach
- Testing the estimators in both simulation and hardware implementation

## Technical Discussion

### System Architecture

The state estimation system consists of several components:

- **Sensor Interface**: Processes raw sensor data from encoders, IMUs, and cameras
- **State Estimators**: Implements various filtering algorithms
- **System Model**: Mathematical representation of the inverted pendulum dynamics
- **Visualization**: Real-time display of estimated states and uncertainties

### Key Technologies

The project leverages several advanced technologies:

- **Kalman Filtering**: For optimal state estimation under Gaussian noise assumptions
- **Extended Kalman Filter**: For handling nonlinear system dynamics
- **Particle Filter**: For non-Gaussian noise and highly nonlinear systems
- **Sensor Fusion**: Combining multiple sensor inputs for improved estimation
- **Real-time Implementation**: Optimized algorithms for high-frequency execution

## Challenges & Solutions

### Development Process

The development followed a structured approach:

1. Mathematical modeling of the inverted pendulum system
2. Implementation of various state estimation algorithms
3. Simulation testing and parameter tuning
4. Hardware integration and real-time implementation
5. Comparative analysis and performance evaluation

### Key Challenges

#### Nonlinear Dynamics
**Challenge**: Accurately modeling and estimating states for the highly nonlinear inverted pendulum system.

**Solution**: Implemented advanced nonlinear estimation techniques (EKF, UKF, and particle filters) and carefully tuned process and measurement noise parameters.

#### Sensor Noise and Bias
**Challenge**: Dealing with noisy sensor measurements and sensor bias.

**Solution**: Developed comprehensive sensor models including noise characteristics and implemented bias estimation as part of the state vector.

#### Real-time Performance
**Challenge**: Ensuring estimation algorithms run in real-time at sufficient frequency.

**Solution**: Optimized implementation using efficient matrix operations and algorithm simplifications where appropriate without sacrificing accuracy.

## Results & Outcomes
