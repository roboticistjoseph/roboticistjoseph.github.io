## Agenda

This project aims to develop a swarm formation system for autonomous drone navigation in GPS-denied environments. The system leverages computer vision and SLAM algorithms to enable drones to navigate safely and efficiently.

Key objectives include:
- Implementing real-time obstacle detection and avoidance
- Developing robust localization in GPS-denied environments
- Creating efficient path planning algorithms for swarm coordination
- Testing and validating the system in various environmental conditions

## Technical Discussion

### System Architecture

The system is built on ROS (Robot Operating System) with a modular architecture that allows for easy integration of different components. The architecture consists of:

- **Perception Module**: Uses stereo cameras and depth sensors to perceive the environment
- **Localization Module**: Implements SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for position tracking
- **Planning Module**: Uses a combination of global and local planning algorithms
- **Control Module**: Translates high-level commands into low-level control signals

### Key Technologies

We utilized several cutting-edge technologies in this project:

- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV for image processing and feature detection
- **SLAM**: ORB-SLAM2 with custom modifications for improved performance
- **Path Planning**: Hybrid approach combining global (A*) and local (Dynamic Window) planning
- **Swarm Coordination**: Custom algorithms for formation control and task allocation

## Challenges & Solutions

### Development Process

The project followed an iterative development approach:

1. Initial prototype with basic navigation capabilities
2. Integration of SLAM algorithms for improved localization
3. Development of obstacle avoidance mechanisms
4. Implementation of swarm coordination algorithms
5. Extensive testing and refinement

### Key Challenges

#### Limited Computational Resources
**Challenge**: Running complex SLAM algorithms on embedded hardware with limited processing power.

**Solution**: Optimized algorithms specifically for embedded systems and offloaded heavy computations to a ground station when possible.

#### Dynamic Environment Handling
**Challenge**: Maintaining accurate localization in changing environments with moving obstacles.

**Solution**: Implemented a multi-layered mapping approach with temporal filtering to distinguish between static and dynamic elements.

#### Inter-Drone Communication
**Challenge**: Ensuring reliable communication between drones in the swarm with minimal latency.

**Solution**: Developed a mesh network protocol with prioritized message passing and redundancy mechanisms.

## Results & Outcomes

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Localization accuracy | Â±5cm |
| Obstacle detection range | 0.5-5m |
| Path planning time | <100ms |
| Maximum swarm size | 8 drones |
| Communication latency | <50ms |

### Future Improvements

Future work on this project will focus on:

- Integration with multi-drone swarm capabilities for complex missions
- Enhanced semantic understanding of the environment
- Implementation of deep reinforcement learning for adaptive behavior
- Improved energy efficiency for extended flight time
- Development of fault-tolerance mechanisms for robust operation
