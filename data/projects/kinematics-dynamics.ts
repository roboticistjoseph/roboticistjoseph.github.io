## Agenda

This project focuses on developing comprehensive kinematics and dynamics models for robotic systems. The goal is to create accurate mathematical representations and efficient computational implementations that can be used for simulation, control, and motion planning.

Key objectives include:
- Implementing forward and inverse kinematics for various robot configurations
- Developing dynamics models using Lagrangian and Newton-Euler formulations
- Creating efficient computational methods for real-time applications
- Validating models through simulation and comparison with physical systems
- Developing trajectory planning algorithms that respect dynamic constraints

## Technical Discussion

### System Architecture

The kinematics and dynamics framework consists of several interconnected components:

- **Kinematics Module**: Handles forward and inverse kinematics calculations
- **Dynamics Module**: Computes equations of motion and simulates system behavior
- **Trajectory Planning**: Generates optimal trajectories considering kinematic and dynamic constraints
- **Visualization**: Provides 3D visualization of robot motion and internal states
- **Validation Tools**: Compares model predictions with experimental data

### Key Technologies

The project leverages several advanced mathematical and computational techniques:

- **Denavit-Hartenberg Parameters**: For systematic representation of kinematic chains
- **Lagrangian Mechanics**: For deriving equations of motion
- **Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm**: For efficient dynamics computation
- **Numerical Integration**: For simulating system behavior over time
- **Optimization Methods**: For trajectory planning and parameter identification
