## Agenda

This project aims to develop an autonomous drone navigation system capable of operating in GPS-denied environments using computer vision and SLAM algorithms. The key objectives include:

- Implementing real-time obstacle detection and avoidance
- Developing a robust localization system using visual markers
- Creating an efficient path planning algorithm for indoor navigation
- Building a user-friendly interface for mission planning and monitoring
- Optimizing for low power consumption and extended flight time

## Technical Discussion

### System Architecture

The system is built on ROS (Robot Operating System) with a modular architecture consisting of:

- Perception module using stereo cameras and depth sensors
- Localization module implementing ORB-SLAM2 algorithm
- $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$$
- Planning module with A* and RRT* path planning
- Control module for precise flight dynamics
- Interface module with web-based dashboard

### Key Technologies

- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV for image processing, feature detection, and object tracking with optimized algorithms for embedded systems.
- **SLAM**: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping using ORB-SLAM2 with custom modifications for improved performance on drones.
- **Path Planning**: Hybrid approach combining global planning (A*) with local obstacle avoidance (Dynamic Window Approach).

## Challenges & Solutions

### Development Process

The project followed an iterative development approach with continuous integration and testing:

1. Initial prototype with basic navigation capabilities
2. Integration of SLAM algorithms and performance optimization
3. Development of obstacle avoidance system
4. Implementation of mission planning interface
5. Extensive testing in various indoor environments
6. Deployment and field validation

### Key Challenges

#### Limited Computational Resources

**Challenge**: Running complex SLAM algorithms on embedded hardware with limited processing power.

**Solution**: Optimized algorithms for embedded systems, implemented efficient feature extraction, and offloaded heavy computations to a ground station when possible.

#### Dynamic Environment Handling

**Challenge**: Maintaining accurate localization in environments with moving objects and changing conditions.

**Solution**: Implemented a multi-layered mapping approach that separates static and dynamic elements, with a temporal filtering mechanism to update the environment model.
